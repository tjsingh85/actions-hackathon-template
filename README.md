# CustomerName + GitHub Hackathon

## Goal

The primary objective of this hackathon is to migrate Jenkins pipeline to GitHub Actions using GitHub Copilot.

## Success Criteria

The success of this project will be measured based on the following key parameters:

- **Functionality**: The migrated pipeline should retain all the functionalities of the original Jenkins pipeline.

- **Performance**: The performance of the GitHub Actions pipeline should be at par or better than the existing Jenkins pipeline.

- **Security**: The GitHub Actions pipeline should adhere to the best security practices and should not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.

- **Dependency**: The new pipeline should aim to reduce the dependency on third-party tools and services.

- **Cost Optimization**: The migration should lead to cost optimization, either by reducing the running cost or by improving the efficiency of the pipeline.
